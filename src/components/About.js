                  <p> Hello! My name is Dane Shrewsbury and I am 31 years old. I was born and raised in Tacoma, WA. In college, I studied Biology with a minor in Chemistry at Gonzaga Unversity.

                 I've always had a passion for technology and its impact on society moving forward! I made this decision to pursue tech to set myself up for a lasting and fulfilling career!
                     </p>
                  <p> If I'm not coding, I'm out enjoying the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest! Some of my outdoor endeavours include skiing, hiking, and biking. </p>
